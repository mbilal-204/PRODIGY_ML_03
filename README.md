Task-03
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

It Includes : 

Data Handling and Preparation: Loads and preprocesses image data from a directory, organizes images into categories (cats and dogs), and performs train-test splitting.

Image Processing: Utilizes image manipulation techniques such as resizing and flattening using Scikit-image.

Modeling: Implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel using Scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Evaluates the SVM model's accuracy on a test set and generates predictions for unlabeled images.

Output: Saves the predictions to a CSV file (svm_test_predictions.csv).
